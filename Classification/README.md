These are the code to do the classification.

* The cluster_kmeans is to cluster by kmenas, the result is not good though.

* The classification is to extract vector features from the description. We use Tf-Idf to get the features. Then we use different way to classify them. This is the main.

* Keyword_search_classifying is to create our training dataset. We use keyword search to classify the data and check them to make sure they are correct.
